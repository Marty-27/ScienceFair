Earth in Greek: Gaia, or in Latin: Terra is the third planet from the Sun,
 the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's
 four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to harbour life.
 
According to evidence from radiometric dating and other sources,
 Earth was formed about 4.54 billion years ago. Earth gravitationally
 interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon.
 During one orbit around the Sun, Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times,
 creating 365.26 solar days or one sidereal year. Earth's axis of rotation
 is tilted 23.4° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane, producing seasonal
 variations on the planet's surface with a period of one tropical year (365.24 solar days).
 
 The Moon is Earth's only permanent natural satellite. Its gravitational interaction
 with Earth causes ocean tides, stabilizes the orientation of Earth's rotational axis,
 and gradually slows Earth's rotational rate.
