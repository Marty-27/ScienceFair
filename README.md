# Unity Science Fair Project

Members : Duc-Huy NGUYEN, Martin GADET

Our project is a interactive 3D science fair where every experience teleport you in another universe. The main scene show 6 tables with 6 buttons that, if they are pressed, will load another scene to teleport you in a new universe.

**We have 6 experiences :**

## The DJ Set

This experience make you become a dj on stage to play some music. In front of you you will see a table with 8 buttons that play different sounds. This table look like a MPC device that most of the dj use to play and sample music. Those buttons can be pressed by using the trigger. Also you can return to the main scene by clicking on the "Return to science fair" text in front of you.

## The Solar system

This experience teleport you in the solar system to explore it.

## Gravity test

In this scene you will be able to choose a planet gravity to see how an object fall on this planet. Around you you will see planets that you can select by clicking on it. Then click on start button to drop an apple to see it falling. If you want to reset the apple position just click on reset button next to the start button. Also you can move in the scene by gliding with the circular button of the controller.
